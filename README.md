Problem
=======

Developers need secure, easy way to discover devices and services in a manner that can work without prior knowledge of network addresses, and can span across networks.

Solution
========

CCNx offers a secure protocol that can be used to support easy discovery of devices and services.  The abridged description of this solution involves each client device or service to publish metadata periodically, in order to "register" under a particular namespace.  Once registered, the API offers ways to discover peers, and enumerate details of peers.

Full details of this solution are defined in the [ccnx-ldplib FSD]().
